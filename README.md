**What is this**

This project consists of multiple C-17 maintenance simulations designed with a focus on a single avionics systems.
It has been in development since December of 2018, designed to address the untapped potential of SmartBoards
that have been in use for the past decade. It provides random scenarios, failures, and allows for free-
form operation. This incorperated input from numerous instructors and students, and designed for group
involvement. Instructors have often been able to use this to perform tasks with near no guidance, students 
are able to focus on using TOs and working as a team.

It does not replace the instructor nor provide step by step instructions. All simulated panel functions should
perform like they do on the aircraft in any order.

**Project Information**

-Built in Unity (LTS) 2018.4.22f

-Designed for use on desktop or SmartBoard


**Features**

-Power on built-in test

-Correct menus interaction via PRGM switch

-Simulates random flare mispoll count (Simulates top-left corner of flare canister not being seated)

-Jettison switch random chance of being on (Fail on power application, student should check per TO)

-Mode switch random chance of being on (Fail on power application, student should check per TO)
